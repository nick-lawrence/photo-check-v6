#This is PhotoCheck v6 that I wrote to help me more efficiently process images with manual review.

Please note that this solution is definitely NOT a be-all, end-all and can absolutely be done better.
I am currently working on a complete re-write of PhotoCheck, complete with a GUI and a more modular coding structure.
